# Snippet

Snippet is a demonstration site for a server-side web application implemented in Go and utilizing a limited set of third-party libraries.
It lets you publish and view snippets of text with storage of the text on a MySQL database.

The code in this repository was initially based upon [Alex Edward's "Let's Go!"](https://lets-go.alexedwards.net/) e-Book.
I highly recommend this book.  It does an excellent job of walking through the principles of a server-side site.
By "initially", I mean that I will continue to modify the implementation to flesh it out as a template for my own efforts to
create new sites.  The original cut at it matching the book will be avialable as the "1.0" release tag.
